Solution:
                        Check System wide summary
1) vmstat 1
    - user time and system time observed
2) mpstart 1
3) pidstat 1 
    - high system and user time is observed

                        Check Disk (Is system time is caused by disk usage)
1) iostat
    -  no load observed
                        Check Network IO

                        Check system calls(Because systime time is high)
1) strace
