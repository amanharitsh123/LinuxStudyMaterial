1) How are you measuring this?

Solution:
                                    Check CPU 
Tools:
    - top. Things to check:
    - us: user time
    - sy: System time
    - id: idle time
    - wa: wait IO

vmstat:
    - Look at CPU stats.
    - Check memory if swapping is happening.

mpstat:
    - See if any single CPU has lots of laod.

                                    Check Disks
iostat:
    - check writes.
    - Check utilization.

                                    Check Network IO
sar -n DEV 1
    - similar to iostat for Networks.
