                    Situation 1: My system is slow. Troubleshoot.

Follow UP:
1) What do you mean by system is slow?
2) Anything changed recently?

Solution:

Tools:
1) top , if cpu load is not much then process is not eating cpu, problem can be IO
2) iostat -x 1 (High tps val means processors are busy, else IO load is not present)
3) netstat -s
4) ss , socket stat
5) sar -n DEV 1 , sar -P 1 will give for all processors seperately
6) vmstat
7) strace -p `pgrep lab002`
8) cat /etc/resolve.conf , DNS issue

Analyze Workload:
1) Who is causing load?

2) why is the laod called?

3) what is the load?

4) How is load changing over time?

5) See for Utilization (Busy Time)
, Saturation (Queue length or queued time) 
and Errors. (objective)

6) Check for disk errors, buses, IO etc.
7) Off CPU analysis, Ex: Blocked waiting,Involuntary Context Switch

8) CPU Profiling Method
